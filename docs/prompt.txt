##Task 1
**Objective:**  
refactor this Express web application using a systematic approach that avoids trial-and-error. this is a windows environment and you are running in powershell.
And this express web application is a working copy of, so you should not break the app. To refactor this express app:
First, You should scan this project except node_modules folder, and study the application logic, this is a working copy express app.
After that, refactor the code to be more modulized, remove duplicated logics, and make it more readable by following the **Archtiecture Pattern** and **Refactor Guide**  

**Archtiecture Pattern**
The key components are:

1. Service Layer: Each service will handle communication with a specific external API (or a set of related endpoints).
2. Controllers: Will use the services to get data and handle the request/response cycle.
3. Routes: Define the endpoints and map them to controllers.
4. Middleware: For authentication, validation, error handling, etc.
5. Configuration: For external API URLs, keys, etc.
6. Utils: For HTTP client, caching, logging, etc.

**Refactor Guide**  
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.   
- Make the express app accessible and friendly with API debug
- Launch the Express app in away that avoid  single-threaded debug mode, avoid get stuck at "Interactive shell awaiting input... press Ctrl+f to focus shell  ..."
- Verify fixes systematically by access the express app and automate the testing, you can accesss log for details
- Using taskkill broadly can indeed terminate the CLI itself. You should be more precise with process management in the future, identifying specific PIDs (e.g., by port number) before termination.
- Do not convert chinese to english, keep the text in chinese.


##Task 2
**Objective:**  
In the sdie bar - component management section, add file batch import functionality. Currently, the import subpage is buggy and automatically redirects back to the dashboard. You need to fix this page.  

The batch file import feature should support:  
- Bulk import from both filesystem paths (local, NFS) and object storage paths.  
- A dedicated batch import panel with status display, resumable transfers, and change detection based on file name and modification date (checksum).  

**Requirements:**  
1. **Status Display** – Task-level overview showing total files and processed count. Support for:  
   - Restart/pause all tasks.  
   - Start/pause individual tasks.  
   - Restart/clear failed tasks.  

2. **Change Detection** – Ability to enable/disable scanning with configurable intervals:  
   - Options: real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly.  
   - Provide a control panel for managing backup cycles.  

**Refactor Guide:**  
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.  
- Ensure the Express app is accessible and API-debug friendly.  
- Launch the Express app in a way that avoids single-threaded debug mode and prevents getting stuck at prompts such as:  
  *“Interactive shell awaiting input... press Ctrl+F to focus shell...”*  
- Verify fixes systematically by accessing the Express app and automating tests. Check logs for details.  
- Avoid using `taskkill` broadly, as it may terminate the CLI itself. Instead, manage processes precisely—for example, by identifying specific PIDs using port numbers before termination.  

**Note:** Keep all original Chinese terms and text unchanged; only restructure and clarify in English.e with process management in the future, identifying specific PIDs (e.g., by port number) before termination.
- Do not convert chinese to english, keep the text in chinese.

## Task 3
Refactor the express web application using a systematic approach that avoids trial-and-error. this is a windows environment and you are running in powershell.
objective: you should build a backend service fastapi rest api service to wrap the data/mockData.js, and update rest of the code (in particular js in services folder) for this fastapi backend service.

**Refactor Guide:**  
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.  
- Ensure the Express app is accessible and API-debug friendly.  
- Launch the Express app in a way that avoids single-threaded debug mode and prevents getting stuck at prompts such as:   *“Interactive shell awaiting input... press Ctrl+F to focus shell...”*  
- Verify fixes systematically by accessing the Express app and automating tests. Check logs for details.  
- Avoid using `taskkill` broadly, as it may terminate the CLI itself. Instead, manage processes precisely—for example, by identifying specific PIDs using port numbers before termination.  

## Task 4
Refactor the express web application using a systematic approach that avoids trial-and-error. this is a windows environment and you are running in powershell.
objective: you should make a clear separation of front-end and back-end for this project; and then add unit test for the project;

**Refactor Guide:**  
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.  
- Ensure the Express front-end app and the fastapi backend app are accessible and API-debug friendly.  
- Launch the apps / processes in a way that avoids single-threaded debug mode and prevents getting stuck at prompts such as:   *“Interactive shell awaiting input... press Ctrl+F to focus shell...”*  
- Verify fixes systematically by accessing the Express app and fast api with automating tests. Check logs for details.  
- Avoid using `taskkill` broadly, as it may terminate the CLI itself. Instead, manage processes precisely—for example, by identifying specific PIDs using port numbers before termination.  


## Task 5
Write unit test for all services in the frontend express web application and backend fastapi services, you should use a systematic approach that avoids trial-and-error. this is a windows environment and you are running in powershell.
objective: Write unit test for all services , perform the tests, make sure the whole application stack works.

**Refactor Guide:**  
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.  
- Ensure the Express front-end app and the fastapi backend app are accessible and API-debug friendly.  
- Launch the apps / processes in a way that avoids single-threaded debug mode and prevents getting stuck at prompts such as:   *“Interactive shell awaiting input... press Ctrl+F to focus shell...”*  
- Verify fixes systematically by accessing the Express app and fast api with automating tests. Check logs for details.  
- Avoid using `taskkill` broadly, as it may terminate the CLI itself. Instead, manage processes precisely—for example, by identifying specific PIDs using port numbers before termination.  


## Task 6
analyze this view pug  @frontend\views\deployment.pug, then you have to rewrite and enrich this view pug, as well as the corresponding frontend and backend services for below funcitonal features.
Since you donot work the actual platform for running the required services, you should simulate those action and response using backend/mockData, so that you do not built, download and run the actual service.

**Objective:**Update deployment.pug and corresponding codes to deploy and manage an AI platform that supports multiple hardware backends, vector databases, and a document parser.

### **1. Core Supported Components**

*   **Target Platforms (Choose 1):**
    *   `nvidia` (using vLLM as the inference engine)
    *   `ascend` (using MindIE as the inference engine)

*   **Vector Database Options (Choose 1+):**
    *   `lancedb`
    *   `milvus`
    *   `chroma`
    *   `pgvector`

*   **Document Parsing Service:**
    *   `mineru` (as the primary service)

---

### **2. Feature Requirements**

#### **2.1 One-Click Deployment Wizard**
*   **Mode Selection:**
    *   `new_deployment`: Install and configure all components from scratch.
    *   `integrate_existing`: Connect to pre-deployed services.
*   **Guided Configuration Flow:** A step-by-step UI/text wizard that collects settings for:
    1.  **Management Interface:** Host, port, and general settings.
    2.  **Inference Engine & Model:** Select platform (`nvidia`/`ascend`), configure model paths, and initial runtime parameters.
    3.  **Vector Database:** Select type and configure connection (host, port, credentials, initial database/collection).
    4.  **Document Parser:** Configure `mineru` service connection.
*   **Automation Output:** The tool must generate deployable artifacts (e.g., shell scripts, Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes YAML, Docker Compose files) based on the wizard's choices.
*   **Config Portability:** Support exporting the final configuration as a file and importing it to replicate the setup.

#### **2.2 Integration with Existing Services**
*   Allow manual entry of service endpoints (URL, port) for any component (inference, vector DB, parser).
*   Provide a "Test Connection" button/function for each manually configured service.
*   Save and manage multiple integration profiles.

#### **2.3 Model Configuration Management**
*   **Model Inventory:** Display a list of models loaded/available in the inference engine.
*   **Parameter Management:** Provide a UI/interface to view and edit configuration for a selected model.
    *   **Inference Params:** Max input/output tokens, temperature, top_p.
    *   **Batching Params:** Batch size, batch delay.
    *   **Resource Params:** GPU/NPU allocation (e.g., device ids, memory fraction).
*   **Configuration Lifecycle:**
    *   Save, export, and import model configuration profiles.
    *   Apply a new configuration to a model (with a clear warning that this may require a service restart).
    *   Support model deployment (loading), switching, and updating.

---

### **3. Technical Implementation Notes**

*   Use configuration templates for each component (`vLLM`, `MindIE`, `lancedb`, etc.) and render final files based on user input.
*   The management tool should interact with component APIs (where available) for operations like listing models or applying configs.
*   Clearly warn users when a configuration change necessitates a service restart.

### **Coding Guide**  
- this is a windows environment and you are running in powershell.
- Use batch syntax checking to identify and fix multiple issues at once.  
- Since you donot work the actual platform for running the required services, you should simulate those action and response using backend/mockData, so that you do not built, download and run the actual service.
- Launch the apps / processes with seperate process and redirect the output to logs, such that you avoids single-threaded debug mode and prevents getting stuck at waiting feedbacks.
- Verify fixes systematically by accessing the frontend app and backend fastapi service with writing unit tests, and you should pass this unit test and Check logs for details.  
- Avoid using `taskkill` broadly, as it may terminate the CLI itself. Instead, manage processes precisely—for example, by identifying specific PIDs using port numbers before termination.  
- Make sure the unit test work, and you run it before finish the job, otherwise retry another approach. Previuosly, You get this error:
